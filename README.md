> Bouncy Ball Web App
- Bouncy Ball Simulation built using vanilla JS, and some styling. It was a passion project for me inspired by many other senior developers/game programmers. Features were added on the fly as they came to my mind. Learnt about the DOM and other great aspects of js, discovered new found interest for web dev while making the project.

Features

Dynamic Ball Creation
  Add multiple balls to the document, each assigned a unique identifier in sequence (`ball1`, `ball2`, ...).

Reset Functionality
  Instantly remove all active balls and reset internal counters and animation state.

Speed Controls
  Adjust animation speed in real time with increase/decrease buttons.

Responsive Performance
  Built using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation with optimal performance.
